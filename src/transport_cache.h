/**
 * This file defines an interface to a FIFO cache. The FIFO is filled with files
 * to transport, and in normal mode is just a memory cache. But if it is filled
 * or if the data in it is too old, files are flushed to disk.
 * 
 * This is intended to be a persistent safe FIFO cache: 
 * everything entering goes out in the same order, even if there is a shutdown in
 * the mean time. However for performance reasons, files are actually flushed to
 * disk after a while (~15s, time to fix according to the usual 'consumption rate'
 * of outgoing files).
 * 
 * One can insert a new file in the cache, get the next file to transmit, or
 * delete a file.
